# Welcome!

I am a very experienced C and intel architectures
assembly developer for GNU/Linux and have a long
history of low-level programming.

I have always been enthusiastic about free
software and GNU/Linux, and have only recently 
decided to shift my attention and presence
to GitHub, seeing it as the new frontier of
open-source software development!

At the moment I am working on three projects:

## 1) ELF writing library: 

Not of as much worth to other developers, this is
just an experiment to mess around with. It is a
functional tool written in C to create ELF object
files. Going to make a repo for it soon.

## 2) Tiny intel Assembler:

I have written many assemblers in my life, but
dropped all of them after a while because I lost
the motivation and endurance. This assembler for
the intel architecture(s) I want to finish, and
put it here on GitHub as inspiration and learning
opportunity for people interested in the field.

## 3) Compact Portable C Compiler:

Same as with the assemblers, I have many C
compiler corpses lurking around. I'll try
to pick out the good pieces and build a new
and strong C compiler from them.
